                "People," Deane said, around a ginger bonbon. "What sort of people? Friends?"Case nodded."Not always that easy to know who your friends are, is it?""I do owe him a little money, Deane. He say anything to you?""Haven’t been in touch, of late." Then he sighed. "If I did know, of course, I might not be in a position totell you. Things being what they are, you understand.""Things?""He’s an important connection Case.""Yeah. He want to kill me, Julie?""Not that I know of." Deane shrugged. They might have been discussing the price of ginger. "If it provesto be an unfounded rumor, old son, you come back in a week or so and I’ll let you in on a littlesomething out of Singapore.""Out of the Nan Hai Hotel, Bencoolen Street?""Loose lips, old son!" Deane grinned. The steel desk was jammed with a fortune in debugging gear."Be seeing you, Julie. I’ll say hello to Wage." Deane’s fingers came up to brush the perfect knot in hispale silk tie.He was less than a block from Deane’s office when it hit, the sudden cellular awareness that someonewas on his ass, and very close.The cultivation of a certain tame paranoia was something Case took for granted. The trick lay in notletting it get out of control. But that could be quite a trick, behind a stack of octagons. He fought theadrenaline surge and composed his narrow features in a mask of bored vacancy, pretending to let thecrowd carry him along. When he saw a darkened display window, he managed to pause by it. The placewas a surgical boutique, closed for renovations. With his hands in the pockets of his jacket, he staredthrough the glass at a flat lozenge of vat grown flesh that lay on a carved pedestal of imitation jade. Thecolor of its skin reminded him of Zone’s whores; it was tattooed with a luminous digital display wiredto a subcutaneous chip. Why bother with the surgery, he found himself thinking, while sweat courseddown his ribs, when you could just carry the thing around in your pocket?Without moving his head, he raised his eyes and studied the reflection of the passing crowd.There.Behind sailors in short-sleeved khaki. Dark hair, mirrored glasses, dark clothing, slender. . .And gone.Then Case was running, bent low, dodging between bodies."Rent me a gun, Shin?"
                The boy smiled. "Two hour." They stood together in the smell of fresh raw seafood at the rear of a Shigasushi stall. "You come back, two hour.""I need one now, man. Got anything right now?" Shin rummaged behind empty two-liter cans that hadonce been filled with powdered horseradish. He produced a slender package wrapped in gray plastic."Taser. One hour, twenty New Yen. Thirty deposit.""Shit. I don’t need that. I need a gun. Like I maybe wanna shoot somebody, understand?"The waiter shrugged, replacing the taser behind the horse-radish cans. "Two hour."He went into the shop without bothering to glance at the display of shuriken. He’d never thrown one inhis life. He bought two packs of Yeheyuans with a Mitsubishi Bank chip that gave his name as CharlesDerek May. It beat Truman Starr, the best he’d been able to do for a passport. The Japanese womanbehind the terminal looked like she had a few years on old Deane, none of them with the benefit ofscience. He took his slender roll of New Yen out of his pocket and showed it to her. "I want to buy aweapon." She gestured in the direction of a case filled with knives."No," he said, "I don’t like knives."She brought an oblong box from beneath the counter. The lid was yellow cardboard, stamped with acrude image of a coiled cobra with a swollen hood. Inside were eight identical tissue-wrappedcylinders. He watched while mottled brown fingers stripped the paper from one. She held the thing upfor him to examine, a dull steel tube with a leather thong at one end and a small bronze pyramid at theother. She gripped the tube with one hand, the pyramid between her other thumb and forefinger, andpulled. Three oiled, telescoping segments of tightly wound coil spring slid out and locked. "Cobra," shesaid.Beyond the neon shudder of Ninsei, the sky was that mean shade of gray. The air had gotten worse; itseemed to have teeth tonight, and half the crowd wore filtration masks. Case had spent ten minutes in aurinal, trying to discover a convenient way to conceal his cobra; finally he’d settled for tucking thehandle into the waistband of his jeans, with the tube slanting across his stomach. The pyramidalstriking tip rode between his ribcage and the lining of his windbreaker. The thing felt like it mightclatter to the pavement with his next step, but it made him feel better.The Chat wasn’t really a dealing bar, but on weeknights it attracted a related clientele. Fridays andSaturdays were different. The regulars were still there, most of them, but they faded behind an influx ofsailors and the specialists who preyed on diem. As Case pushed through the doors, he looked for Ratz,but the bartender wasn’t in sight. Lonny Zone, the bar’s resident pimp, was observing with glazedfatherly interest as one of his girls went to work on a young sailor. Zone was addicted to a brand ofhypnotic the Japanese called Cloud Dancers. Catching the pimp’s eye, Case beckoned him to the bar.Zone came drifting through the crowd in slow motion, his long face slack and placid."You seen Wage tonight, Lonny?"Zone regarded him with his usual calm. He shook his head."You sure, man?""Maybe in the Namban. Maybe two hours ago."
                "Got some Joeboys with him? One of ‘em thin, dark hair, maybe a black jacket?""No," Zone said at last, his smooth forehead creased to indicate the effort it cost him to recall so muchpointless detail. "Big boys. Graftees." Zone’s eyes showed very little white and less iris; under thedrooping lids, his pupils were dilated and enormous. He stared into Case’s face for a long time, thenlowered his gaze. He saw the bulge of the steel whip. "Cobra," he said, and raised an eyebrow. "Youwanna fuck somebody up?""See you, Lonny." Case left the bar.His tail was back. He was sure of it. He felt a stab of elation the octagons and adrenaline mingling withsomething else. You’re enjoying this, he thought; you’re crazy. Because, in some weird and veryapproximate way, it was like a run in the matrix. Get just wasted enough, find yourself in somedesperate but strangely arbitrary kind of trouble, and it was possible to see Ninsei as a field of data, theway the matrix had once reminded him of proteins linking to distinguish cell specialties. Then youcould throw yourself into a highspeed drift and skid, totally engaged but set apart from it all, and allaround you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made flesh in the mazes of the black market .. . Go it, Case, he told himself. Suck ‘em in. Last thing they’ll expect. He was half a block from the gamesarcade where he’d first met Linda Lee.He bolted across Ninsei, scattering a pack of strolling sailors. One of them screamed after him inSpanish. Then he was through the entrance, the sound crashing over him like surf, subsonics throbbingin the pit of his stomach. Someone scored a ten-megaton hit on Tank War Europa, a simulated air burstdrowning the arcade in white sound as a lurid hologram fireball mushroomed overhead. He cut to theright and loped up a flight of unpainted chip board stairs. He’d come here once with Wage, to discuss adeal in proscribed hormonal triggers with a man called Matsuga. He remembered the hallway, itsstained matting, the row of identical doors leading to tiny office cubicles. One door was open now. AJapanese girl in a sleeveless black t-shirt glanced up from a white terminal, behind her head a travelposter of Greece, Aegian blue splashed with streamlined ideograms."Get your security up here," Case told her. Then he sprinted down the corridor, out of her sight. The lasttwo doors were closed and, he assumed, locked. He spun and slammed the sole of his nylon runningshoe into the blue-lacquered composition door at the far end. It popped, cheap hardware falling fromthe splintered frame. Darkness there, the white curve of a terminal housing. Then he was on the door toits right, both hands around the transparent plastic knob, leaning in with everything he had. Somethingsnapped, and he was inside. This was where he and Wage had met with Matsuga, but whatever frontcompany Matsuga had operated was long gone. No terminal, nothing. Light from the alley behind thearcade, filtering in through soot blown plastic. He made out a snake like loop of fiber optics protrudingfrom a wall socket, a pile of discarded food containers, and the blade less nacelle of an electric fan.The window was a single pane of cheap plastic. He shrugged out of his jacket, bundled it around hisright hand, and punched. It split, requiring two more blows to free it from the frame. Over the mutedchaos of the games, an alarm began to cycle, triggered either by the broken window or by the girl at thehead of the corridor.Case turned, pulled his jacket on, and flicked the cobra to full extension.With the door closed, he was counting on his tail to assume he’d gone through the one he’d kicked halfoff its hinges. The cobra’s bronze pyramid began to bob gently, the spring-steel shaft amplifying hispulse.
                Nothing happened. There was only the surging of the alarm, the crashing of the games, his hearthammering. When the fear came, it was like some half-forgotten friend. Not the cold rapid mechanismof the dex-paranoia, but simple animal fear. He’d lived for so long on a constant edge of anxiety thathe’d almost forgotten what real fear was.This cubicle was the sort of place where people died. He might die here. They might have guns . . . Acrash, from the far end of the corridor. A man’s voice, shouting something in Japanese. A scream, shrillterror. Another crash.And footsteps, unhurried, coming closer. Passing his closed door. Pausing for the space of three rapidbeats of his heart. And returning. One, two, three. A bootheel scraped the matting.The last of his octagon-induced bravado collapsed. He snapped the cobra into its handle and scrambledfor the window, blind with fear, his nerves screaming. He was up, out, and falling, all before he wasconscious of what he’d done. The impact with pavement drove dull rods of pain through his shins. Anarrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and thechassis of a junked console. He’d fallen face forward on a slab of soggy chip board, he rolled over, intothe shadow of the console. The cubicle’s window was a square of faint light. The alarm still oscillated,louder here, the rear wall dulling the roar of the games.A head appeared, framed in the window, back lit by the fluorescents in the corridor, then vanished. Itreturned, but he still couldn’t read the features. Glint of silver across the eyes. "Shit," someone said, awoman, in the accent of the northern Sprawl.The head was gone. Case lay under the console for a long count of twenty, then stood up. The steelcobra was still in his hand, and it took him a few seconds to remember what it was. He limped awaydown the alley, nursing his left ankle. Shin’s pistol was a fifty-year-old Vietnamese imitation of a SouthAmerican copy of a Walther PPK, double-action on the first shot, with a very rough pull. It waschambered for .22 long rifle, and Case would’ve preferred lead azide explosives to the simple Chinesehollow points Shin had sold him. Still it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he madehis way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his jacket pocket. The grips were bright redplastic molded in a raised dragon motif, something to run your thumb across in the dark. He’dconsigned the cobra to a dump canister on Ninsei and dry-swallowed another octagon.The pill lit his circuits and he rode the rush down Shiga to Ninsei, then over to Baiitsu. His tail, he’ddecided, was gone and that was fine. He had calls to make, biz to transact, and it wouldn’t wait. A blockdown Baiitsu, toward the port, stood a featureless ten-story office building in ugly yellow brick. Itswindows were dark now, but a faint glow from the roof was visible if you craned your neck. An unlitneon sign near the main entrance offered CHEAP HOTEL under a cluster of ideograms. If the place hadanother name, Case didn’t know it; it was always referred to as Cheap Hotel. You reached it through analley off Baiitsu, where an elevator waited at the foot of a transparent shaft. The elevator, like CheapHotel, was an afterthought, lashed to the building with bamboo and epoxy. Case climbed into the plasticcage and used his key, an unmarked length of rigid magnetic tape.Case had rented a coffin here, on a weekly basis, since he’d arrived in Chiba, but he’d never slept inCheap Hotel. He slept in cheaper places.The elevator smelled of perfume and cigarettes; the sides of the cage was scratched and thumb-smudged. As it passed the fifth floor, he saw the lights of Ninsei. He drummed his fingers against thepistol grip as the cage slowed with a gradual hiss. As always, it came to a full stop with a violent jolt, buthe was ready for it. He stepped out into the courtyard that served the place as some combination of
                lobby and lawn. Centered in the square carpet of green plastic turf, a Japanese teenager sat behind aC-shaped console, reading a textbook. The white fiberglass coffins were racked in a framework ofindustrial scaffolding. Six tiers of coffins, ten coffins on a side. Case nodded in the boy’s direction andlimped across the plastic grass to the nearest ladder. The compound was roofed with cheap laminatedmatting that rattled in a strong wind and leaked when it rained, but the coffins were reasonablydifficult to open without a key.The expansion-grate catwalk vibrated with his weight as he edged his way along the third tier toNumber 92. The coffins were three meters long, the oval hatches a meter wide and just under a meterand a half tall. He fed his key into the slot and waited for verification from the house computer.Magnetic bolts thudded reassuringly and the hatch rose vertically with a creak of springs. Fluorescentsflickered on as he crawled in, pulling the hatch shut behind him and slapping the panel that activatedthe manual latch.There was nothing in Number 92 but a standard Hitachi pocket computer and a small white styrofoamcooler chest. The cooler contained the remains of three ten-kilo slabs of dry ice carefully wrapped inpaper to delay evaporation, and a spun aluminum lab flask. Crouching on the brown temper foam slabthat was both floor and bed, Case took Shin’s .22 from his pocket and put it on top of the cooler. Then hetook off his jacket. The coffin’s terminal was molded into one concave wall, opposite a panel listinghouse rules in seven languages. Case took the pink handset from its cradle and punched a Hongkongnumber from memory. He let it ring five times, then hung up. His buyer for the three megabytes of hotRAM in the Hitachi wasn’t taking calls.He punched a Tokyo number in Shinjuku.A woman answered, something in Japanese."Snake Man there?""Very good to hear from you," said Snake Man, coming in on an extension. "I’ve been expecting yourcall.""I got the music you wanted." Glancing at the cooler."I’m very glad to hear that. We have a cash flow problem.Can you front?""Oh, man, I really need the money bad . . ."Snake Man hung up."You shit " Case said to the humming receiver. He stared at the cheap little pistol."Iffy," he said, "it’s all looking very iffy tonight."Case walked into the Chat an hour before dawn, both hands in the pockets of his jacket; one held therented pistol, the other the aluminum flask.Ratz was at a rear table, drinking Apollonaris water from a beer pitcher, his hundred and twenty kilos
                of doughy flesh tilted against the wall on a creaking chair. A Brazilian kid called Kurt was on the bar,tending a thin crowd of mostly silent drunks. Ratz’s plastic arm buzzed as he raised the pitcher anddrank. His shaven head was filmed with sweat. "You look bad, friend artiste," he said, flashing the wetruin of his teeth. "I’m doing just fine," said Case, and grinned like a skull. "Super fine." He sagged into thechair opposite Ratz, hands still in his pockets."And you wander back and forth in this portable bombshelter built of booze and ups, sure. Proofagainst the grosser emotions, yes?""Why don’t you get off my case, Ratz? You seen Wage?""Proof against fear and being alone," the bartender continued. "Listen to the fear. Maybe it’s yourfriend.""You hear anything about a fight in the arcade tonight, Ratz?Somebody hurt?""Crazy cut a security man." He shrugged. "A girl, they say.""I gotta talk to Wage, Ratz, I . . .""Ah." Ratz’s mouth narrowed, compressed into a single line. He was looking past Case, toward theentrance. "I think you are about to."Case had a sudden flash of the shuriken in their window. The speed sang in his head. The pistol in hishand was slippery with sweat."Herr Wage," Ratz said, slowly extending his pink manipulator as if he expected it to be shaken. "Howgreat a pleasure. Too seldom do you honor us."Case turned his head and looked up into Wage’s face. It was a tanned and forgettable mask. The eyeswere vat grown sea-green Nikon transplants. Wage wore a suit of gunmetal silk and a simple braceletof platinum on either wrist. He was flanked by his Joe boys, nearly identical young men, their arms andshoulders bulging with grafted muscle. "How you doing, Case?""Gentlemen," said Ratz, picking up the table’s heaped ash-tray in his pink plastic claw, "I want notrouble here." The ashtray was made of thick, shatterproof plastic, and advertised Tsingtao beer. Ratzcrushed it smoothly, butts and shards of green plastic cascading onto the table top. "You understand?""Hey, sweetheart," said one of the Joe boys, "you wanna try that thing on me?""Don’t bother aiming for the legs, Kurt," Ratz said, his tone conversational. Case glanced across theroom and saw the Brazilian standing on the bar, aiming a Smith and Wesson riot gun at the trio. Thething’s barrel, made of paper-thin alloy wrapped with a kilometer of glass filament, was wide enoughto swallow a fist. The skeletal magazine revealed five fat orange cartridges, subsonic sandbag jellies."Technically nonlethal," said Ratz."Hey, Ratz," Case said, "I owe you one." The bartender shrugged. "Nothing, you owe me. These," and heglowered at Wage and the Joe boys, "should know better. You don’t take anybody off in the Chatsubo."Wage coughed. "So who’s talking about taking anybody off? We just wanna talk business. Case and me,
                we work together."Case pulled the .22 out of his pocket and level led it at Wage’s crotch. "I hear you wanna do me." Ratz’spink claw closed around the pistol and Case let his hand go limp. "Look, Case, you tell me what the fuckis going on with you, you wig or something? What’s this shit I’m trying to kill you?" Wage turned to theboy on his left. "You two go back to the Namban. Wait for me."Case watched as they crossed the bar, which was now entirely deserted except for Kurt and a drunkensailor in khakis, who was curled at the foot of a barstool. The barrel of the Smith and Wesson tracked thetwo to the door, then swung back to cover Wage. The magazine of Case’s pistol clattered on the table.Ratz held the gun in his claw and pumped the round out of the chamber."Who told you I was going to hit you, Case?" Wage asked.Linda."Who told you, man? Somebody trying to set you up?"The sailor moaned and vomited explosively. "Get him out of here," Ratz called to Kurt, who was sittingon the edge of the bar now, the Smith abd Wesson across his lap, lighting a cigarette.Case felt the weight of the night come down on him like a bag of wet sand settling behind his eyes. Hetook the flask out of his pocket and handed it to Wage. "All I got. Pituitaries. Get you five hundred if youmove it fast. Had the rest of my roll in some RAM, but that’s gone by now.""You okay, Case?" The flask had already vanished behind a gunmetal lapel. "I mean, fine, this’ll squareus, but you look bad. Like hammered shit. You better go somewhere and sleep.""Yeah." He stood up and felt the Chat sway around him."Well, I had this fifty, but I gave it to somebody." He giggled. He picked up the .22’s magazine and theone loose cartridge and dropped them into one pocket, then put the pistol in the other. "I gotta see Shin,get my deposit back.""Go home," said Ratz, shifting on the creaking chair with something like embarrassment. "Artiste. Gohome." He felt them watching as he crossed the room and shouldered his way past the plastic doors."Bitch," he said to the rose tint over Shiga. Down on Ninsei the holograms were vanishing like ghosts,and most of the neon was already cold and dead. He sipped thick black coffee from a street vendor’sfoam thimble and watched the sun come up. "You fly away, honey. Towns like this are for people wholike the way down." But that wasn’t it, really, and he was finding it increasingly hard to maintain thesense of betrayal. She just wanted a ticket home, and the RAM in his Hitachi would buy it for her, if shecould find the right fence. And that business with the fifty; she’d almost turned it down, knowing shewas about to rip him for the rest of what he had. When he climbed out of the elevator, the same boy wason the desk. Different textbook. "Good buddy," Case called across the plastic turf, "you don’t need to tellme. I know already. Pretty lady came to visit, said she had my key. Nice little tip for you, say fifty Newones?" The boy put down his book. "Woman," Case said, and drew a line across his forehead with histhumb. "Silk." He smiled broadly. The boy smiled back, nodded. "Thanks, ass hole," Case said.On the catwalk, he had trouble with the lock. She’d messed it up somehow when she’d fiddled it, hethought. Beginner. He knew where to rent a black box that would open anything in Cheap Hotel.
                Fluorescents came on as he crawled in. "Close the hatch real slow, friend. You still got that Saturdaynight special you rented from the waiter?" She sat with her back to the wall, at the far end of the coffin.She had her knees up, resting her wrists on them, the pepper box muzzle of a flechette pistol emergedfrom her hands. "That you in the arcade?" He pulled the hatch down."Where’s Linda?""Hit that latch switch."He did."That your girl? Linda?"He nodded."She’s gone. Took your Hitachi. Real nervous kid. What about the gun, man?" She wore mirroredglasses. Her clothes were black, the heels of black boots deep in the temper foam. "I took it back toShin, got my deposit. Sold his bullets back to him for half what I paid. You want the money?""No.""Want some dry ice? All I got, right now.""What got into you tonight? Why’d you pull that scene at the arcade? I had to mess up this rentacopcame after me with nun chucks. ""Linda said you were gonna kill me.""Linda said? I never saw her before I came up here.""You aren’t with Wage?"She shook her head. He realized that the glasses were surgically inset, sealing her sockets. The silverlenses seemed to grow from smooth pale skin above her cheekbones, framed by dark hair cut in arough shag. The fingers curled around the fletcher were slender, white, tipped with polished burgundy.The nails looked artificial. "I think you screwed up, Case. I showed up and you just fit me right into yourreality picture.""So what do you want, lady?" He sagged back against the hatch."You. One live body, brains still somewhat intact. Molly, Case. My name’s Molly. I’m collecting you forthe man I work for. Just wants to talk, is all. Nobody wants to hurt you ""That’s good.""’Cept I do hurt people sometimes, Case. I guess it’s just the way I’m wired." She wore tight black gloveleather jeans and a bulky black jacket cut from some matte fabric that seemed to absorb light. "If I putthis dart gun away, will you be easy, Case? You look like you like to take stupid chances.""Hey, I’m very easy. I’m a pushover, no problem.""That’s fine, man." The fletcher vanished into the black jacket. "Because you try to fuck around with me,
                you’ll be taking one of the stupidest chances of your whole life." She held out her hands, palms up, thewhite fingers slightly spread, and with a barely audible click, ten double-edged, four-centimeter scalpelblades slid from their housings beneath the burgundy nails.She smiled. The blades slowly withdrew.
